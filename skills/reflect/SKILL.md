# Reflect

Before using T3 tools, read [the runtime contract](../p3-mode/references/t3-runtime.md).

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Read the current T3 thread with `t3_thread_read` and `t3_thread_search`, scoped to this conversation. Reviewers get only their brief. Pass the thread ID and ask for activity view when they need tool-call evidence, or give a tight digest. Never search unrelated projects.

## 2. Review

One turn, three `delegate_task` calls with `mode: "async"`. Reviewers need tool access for context lookups (tickets, chat threads, observability traces referenced in the transcript), so do not restrict their tools.

Resolve each model from the role line in `p3-models.md` via `orchestrator_capabilities`. Never hardcode a slug.

| Lens | Role line | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim as the brief, substituting the thread id or digest where marked. Drain with `task_status`; reviewers return findings in their task result.

## 3. Synthesize

One `delegate_task` call, model from the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line. The synthesizer's quality check includes spot-verifying citations, which can require tool access. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim as the brief, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to your harness's skill-authoring skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop. Use an available authoring skill or the Agent Skills format at agentskills.io. "`create-skill`" below means whichever of these you use.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `create-skill` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via create-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `create-skill`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
